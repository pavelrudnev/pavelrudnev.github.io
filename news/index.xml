      <description>I have recently given a presentation at the third installment of the Formal Approaches to Russian Linguistics workshop at Lomonosov Moscow State University. In my talk, I have tried to adapt an exhaustification analysis of PPI-disjunction to the facts of Russian. An abstract and a set of slides are available here.</description>

      <description>A team of researchers at HSE, including myself, has recently been awarded a highly competitive and prestigious grant by the Russian Science Foundation. Over the next few years, we&amp;rsquo;ll be investigating non-finite constructions in a number of severely understudied languages of Russia (Avar, Bagwalal, Udi, Agul, Hill Mari, Meadow Mari, Northern Khanty, Chukchi). The project&amp;rsquo;s title is When the verb isn&amp;rsquo;t a verb: Non-finite constructions in the languages of Russia, and you can read more about it here.</description>

      <title>Avar negation (talk at the Russian Academy of Sciences)</title>

      <description>I have recently presented my ongoing work on the syntactico-semantic properties of negation in Avar in the Andic seminar at the Institute of Linguistics of the Russian Academy of Sciences. This was my first Russian-language presentation after a long lull.
In the talk, I argued that the rather idiosyncratic morphosyntactic properties of Avar negation, as well as the restrictions on the expression and interpretation of negation, can be accounted for in a framework postulating an ontological distinction between (sets of) events and (sets of) situations as conceptual underpinnings of the hierarchy of functional projections.</description>

      <description>I will present my recent work on the PPI-behaviour of the Russian plain disjunction marker ili at the 33rd annual meeting of the Israel Association for Theoretical Linguistics. In the talk, I argue that that behaviour as well as the apparent exceptions can be derived from the phrasal versus clausal character of the disjunction, and the status of Russian as a negative concord language.</description>

      <description>My paper on long-distance anaphora in Avar has finally appeared in Studia Linguistica. In it I offer a detailed description of the distribution of two long-distance reflexives&amp;mdash;žiwgo and žiw.
If this looks interesting to you, please take a look. I&amp;rsquo;d appreciate your feedback. Thanks!</description>
